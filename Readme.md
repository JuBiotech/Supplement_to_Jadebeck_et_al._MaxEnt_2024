Supplement to Trans-dimensional Diffusive Nested Sampling for Metabolic Network Inference


Supplement is available at [https://github.com/JuBiotech/Supplement\_to\_Jadebeck\_et\_al.\_MaxEnt\_2024](https://github.com/JuBiotech/Supplement\_to\_Jadebeck\_et\_al.\_MaxEnt\_2024)

This directory contains the FluxML models (including simulated data),
and the DNest4 results. The implementation of trans-dimensional diffusive nested sampling uses DNest4 source code and is integrated into the open-source library hops https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/IBG-1/ModSim/hops.
